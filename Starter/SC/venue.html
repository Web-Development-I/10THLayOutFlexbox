          The Chicago Theater is one of Chicago's most iconic buildings. It is
          not without reason that the theater is featured on almost all tourist
          brochures and maps of the Windy City. Chicago's premier theater was
          built in 1921 and is located in The Loop, also known as Downtown. The
          theater is one of the most beautiful in America and can be visited
          almost every day, both during performances and guided tours.

          The structure is seven stories tall and fills nearly one half of a
          city block. The 60-foot (18 m) wide by six-story tall triumphal arch
          motif of the State Street façade has been journalistically compared to
          the l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris.The central arch-headed window adapts
          the familiar motif of Borromini's false-perspective window reveals of
          the top floor of Palazzo Barberini, Rome. The coat of arms of the
          Balaban and Katz chain—two horses holding ribbons of 35 mm film in
          their mouths outlined by a border of film reels—is set inside a
          circular Tiffany stained glass window inside the arch. The exterior of
          the building is covered in off-white architectural terracotta supplied
          by the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company with Neo-Baroque stucco
          designs by the McNulty Brothers.
